# svelte-ui-api-template

A template I use to spin up a new svelte project. Originally created with [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) and afterwards extended with tailwindcss, flowbite-svelte and prettier.

## Developing

Once cloned, use `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) to install the dependencies and then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
